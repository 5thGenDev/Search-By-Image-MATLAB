# Search-By-Image-MATLAB
We aim to create a more robust algorithm than Google Search-By-Image. 
Implementation instruction to perform the 1st spec is in lab sheet week 3, the rest is in my report file and in cwork_basecode2022. 

In the report: I've explained the concepts
In MATLAB files in cwork_base2022 folder, I've commented extensively to explain on the concepts and implementations so they are self-explanatory. 
If not read them in conjunction with my report.
